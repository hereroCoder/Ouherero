  <section class="content-section history" id="history">
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The Ovaherero people migrated from East Africa to present-day Namibia around the 16th century, bringing vast herds of
    cattle, sheep, and goats with them as a pastoralist community. Their entire way of life revolved around these animals.</p>

    <p>Cattle are central to their way of life, not just for sustenance but also as a symbol of wealth and status. They
    historically lived in communities organized around cattle herding, and their homes were often made using a mix of cow
    dung and mud.</p>
    <p>
    During the 1904 genocide, many Ovaherero fled Namibia to neighboring countries like Botswana and South Africa. However,
    a considerable number eventually returned. Today, you can find significant Herero populations in Namibia ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¦, Botswana
    ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¼, and Angola ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡´.</p>

  <section  class="content-section" id="food">
    <h2>Food</h2>

    <p>As pastoral farmers, the Herero's staple foods revolve around their livestock</p>
    <h3>Meat</h3>
    <p>
      Meat holds a central place in their diet, with certain parts designated for specific demographicsâ€”some portions are
      solely for males, females, or adults. For instance, children don't consume tongue, while the pelvic part is reserved for
      males or forbidden for females.</p>

    <h3>Sour Milk</h3>
    <p>
    Omaere, a significant part of traditional Herero culture, is produced by women who handle the milking and acidification
    of milk. Girls are taught these techniques from an early age.</p>


    <h3>Tradtional Butter</h3>
    <p>
    The Herero produce their own butter, a traditional delicacy that enhances the flavor of many dishes. However, its
    production isn't a year-round activity. It occurs when cows are producing ample milk, usually during rainy seasons when
    the cows have sufficient food. During drought seasons, milk preservation for calves takes precedence, leading to reduced
    milking and less butter production.</p>

  </section>
  <!-- Attire -->
  <section class="content-section" id="attire">
    <h2>Attire</h2>
    <p>The women's distinctive Victorian-style dress is known as "Ozonde". Ovaherero added a distinctive horn-like headscarf known as 'otjikaiva,' typically crafted from fabric matching the dress.
    This horned feature symbolizes the revered cattle, representing wealth and status within their communities.</p>
    <p>Over time, the dress patterns have evolved, and the otjikaiva has taken on a more defined shape. These dresses have
    become a canvas for vibrant colors and incorporate various modern patterns, showcasing the Ovaherero's adaptation to
    contemporary influences while preserving their cultural identity.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Entertainment -->
  <section class="content-section" id="entertainment">
    <h2>Entertainment</h2>
    <h3>Traditional dance</h3>
    <p>The "Omuhiva" dance is a beloved tradition among the Herero people, where men emulate the movements of cattle by stamping
    their feet, kicking up dust, and mimicking the upraised horns through swaying motions.</p>
    <p> During the "Outjina", a female lead
    ties wooden pieces to her feet, creating captivating sounds while stamping. Others form a circle around the main dance,
    singing, and clapping. The lead dancer typically leads both the dance and the song.</p>

    <h3>Oviritje</h3>
    <p>Another facet of Ovaherero culture is Oviritje music. Oviritje has evolved over time. While initially performed without
    instruments, today, keyboardists, producers, and both male and female artists contribute to this genre.</p> 
    
    <p>In the early
    2000s, groups like Opouua, ORemember, and Okazera were prominent, but solo artists have become more prevalent. People
    now commission songs for special occasions like weddings, birthdays, or graduations. However, older generations still
    tend to prefer traditional Herero hymns, otjina, and muhiva over Oviritje. These songs not only entertain but also
    impart life lessons and Herero sayings, preserving wisdom and cultural teachings through music.</p>
