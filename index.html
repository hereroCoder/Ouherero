    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The Ovaherero people migrated from East Africa to present-day Namibia around the 16th century, bringing vast herds of
    cattle, sheep, and goats with them as a pastoralist community. Their entire way of life revolved around these animals.</p>

    <p>Cattle are central to their way of life, not just for sustenance but also as a symbol of wealth and status. They
    historically lived in communities organized around cattle herding, and their homes were often made using a mix of cow
    dung and mud.</p>
    <p>
    During the 1904 genocide, many Ovaherero fled Namibia to neighboring countries like Botswana and South Africa. However,
    a considerable number eventually returned. Today, you can find significant Herero populations in Namibia ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¦, Botswana
    ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¼, and Angola ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡´.</p>

    <h2>Food</h2>

    <p>The Herero rely on their livestock for the majority of their food. These animals provide crucial nourishment through their meat and milk. They ensure the full utilization of slaughtered
    animals. The skin is repurposed into mats, while the tail serves various traditional functions,
    occasionally being used as a broom for their huts</p>

              Meat holds a central place in their diet, with certain parts designated solely for males, females, or adults.</p>
            <p>For instance, children don't eat tongue, while the pelvic part is reserved
              for males.</p>

              Omaere (Sour milk), a significant part of traditional Herero culture, is produced by women who handle the milking and acidification of milk.</p>

            Herero make their own butter. It is made by shaking milk in a container called ondjupa.
          </p>
          <p>
            The production is usually done during rainy seasons. During droughts, milk is preserved for calves.

        <p>The women's distinctive Victorian-style dress is known as "Ozonde". Ovaherero added a distinctive horn-like
          headscarfknown as 'otjikaiva,' typically crafted from fabric matching the dress.</p>
        <p>This horned feature symbolizes the revered cattle, representing wealth and status within their communities.</p>

  <!-- Entertainment -->
  <section class="content-section" id="entertainment">
    <h2>Entertainment</h2>
    <h3>Traditional dance</h3>
    <p>The "Omuhiva" dance is a beloved tradition among the Herero people, where men emulate the movements of cattle by stamping
    their feet, kicking up dust, and mimicking the upraised horns through swaying motions.</p>
    <p> During the "Outjina", a female lead
    ties wooden pieces to her feet, creating captivating sounds while stamping. Others form a circle around the main dance,
    singing, and clapping. The lead dancer typically leads both the dance and the song.</p>

    <h3>Oviritje</h3>
    <p>Another facet of Ovaherero culture is Oviritje music. Oviritje has evolved over time. While initially performed without
    instruments, today, keyboardists, producers, and both male and female artists contribute to this genre.</p> 
    
    <p>In the early
    2000s, groups like Opouua, ORemember, and Okazera were prominent, but solo artists have become more prevalent. People
    now commission songs for special occasions like weddings, birthdays, or graduations. However, older generations still
    tend to prefer traditional Herero hymns, otjina, and muhiva over Oviritje. These songs not only entertain but also
    impart life lessons and Herero sayings, preserving wisdom and cultural teachings through music.</p>
